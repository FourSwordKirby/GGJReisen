Reisen: [expression] shock

Kogasa: Boo! 

Reisen: Eeeep! 

Kogasa: W-wait, that actually worked? 
And on a visiting youkai nonetheless.

Reisen: [expression] sad
Reisen: W-well, anyone would be terrified by someone appearing out of thin air...

Kogasa: Out of thin air? But I was just standing here.
"Boo!" is my usual greeting.

Reisen: **She definitely wasn't there a second ago...
**Is this a side effect of the <b>virus</b>...?
