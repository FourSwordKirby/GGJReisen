[instruction] Boo

Kogasa: Boo! 

Reisen: [expression] worry

Reisen: Eeeep! 

Kogasa: W-wait that actually worked?

Reisen: [expression] frown

Reisen: W-well, anyone would be terrified by someone appearing out of thin air 

Kogasa: Out of thin air? But I was just standing here 

"Boo!" is just my usual greeting 

Reisen: **Is this another effect of the dimensionality reduction?
