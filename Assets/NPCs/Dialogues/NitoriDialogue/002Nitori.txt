//002 â€“ Fetch Quest 

Nitori: I seem to have lost my <b>tool</b>...
Hey rabbit, make yourself useful and find it for me.

Reisen: [expression] angry
Why would I listen to such a rude request? 

Nitori: Do you have anything better to do? 

Reisen: I'm in a middle of solving an incident! 

Nitori: An <b>incident</b>?
Is there something like that happening? 

Reisen: Look around you!

Nitori: ... Not sure what I'm looking for. 
Does this involve the new <b>contraptions</b> around town? 

Reisen: [expression] sweat
**Is she talking about the <b>Dimensionality Reducers</b>?
[expression] normal
Do you know about them?

Nitori: ...
... Maybe a thing or two.
If you can find my <b>tool</b>, I'll share what I know. 
I probably dropped it near the <b>school</b>. 

Reisen: [expression] sad
*sigh*
