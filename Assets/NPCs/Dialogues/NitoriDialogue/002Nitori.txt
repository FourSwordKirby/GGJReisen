//002 â€“ Fetch Quest 

Nitori: Huh? It seems like I dropped my <b>tool</b> somewhere. 

Hey rabbit, why don't you make yourself useful and find it for me. 

Reisen: Why would I listen to such a rude request? 

Nitori: Do you have anything better to do? 

Reisen: I'm in a middle of solving an incident! 

Nitori: An incident? Is there something like that happening? 

Reisen: Look around you! 

Nitori: ... Not sure what I'm looking for. 

Does it have something to do with that <b>contraption</b> next to the school? 

Reisen: Do you know about it? 

Nitori: ... Maybe a thing or two. 

I probably dropped my <b>tool</b> somewhere around there. 

Why don't you pick it up for me and I'll share? 

Reisen: *sigh*
