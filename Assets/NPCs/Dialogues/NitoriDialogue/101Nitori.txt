//101 â€“ Inspiration 

Nitori: Hmm, I'm not making much progress... 

Reisen: On creating the storage box?

Nitori: Oh, it's the rabbit again. 
Didn't I tell you I'm busy with very important work? 

Reisen: [expression] sad
**If I say something, I should choose my words carefully...

[choice] [Lunarian science is beyond you. | science] [Did you cause the incident? | culprit] [Leave | leave]

Reisen: [expression] heh [science]
I doubt an Earthling could learn Lunarian Science in a day. 

Nitori: You're awfully arrogant for a rabbit that only knows how to pound mochi.

Reisen: [expression] happy
I'll have you know, I'm a Moon Rabbit.
[expression] heh
We're far superior to those silly Earth Bunnies. 

Nitori: You all look the same to me.
Wait... you're a Lunarian!?
Can you explain how the <b>simplification</b> process works!?

Reisen: [expression] happy
For the <b>Dimensionality Reducer</b>? Yeah of course! 

Nitori: Oh! So how does it work!? 

Reisen: [expression] heh
Yeah, it...
... 
[expression] annoy
Uh ...

Nitori: I see Moon Rabbits are as disappointing as Earth Rabbits...

Reisen: [expression] shock
No that's not it!
[expression] annoy
It's just... not my field of expertise... 
[expression] sad
I can explain all the wave mathematics in its moonlight cells... 
[expression] ugh
But, I don't know anything about data compression algorithms...
[expression] sad
And I'm guessing that's what the <b>simplification</b> process uses.

Nitori: *sigh* Back to square one, huh.
But still, a Lunarian?
Rather surprising.

Reisen: [expression] annoy
Ex-Lunarian.

Nitori: I might have some questions for you later.
Let's keep in touch?

Reisen: [expression] sad
Um... sure, I guess.
[expression] sweat
**Oh, a personality shard manifested!

Reisen: **Maybe this is the culprit of this incident. [culprit]
**I'll just ask her directly.
[expression] heh
**I can use my <b>Lunatic Red Eyes</b> to tell if she's lying.
[expression] sweat
**Okay, here it goes...
[expression] normal
You said you broke one of the contraptions in the village? 

Nitori: Huh? Maybe? I don't know.

Reisen: Let's just cut to the chase...
[expression] angry
Are you the one responsible for this incident? 

Nitori: You were babbling something like that earlier too. 
What incident? I haven't done anything. 

Reisen: There's a <b>simplification</b> virus afflicting the whole village!

Nitori: A virus?
The humans looked healthy when I left this morning. 
Did something happen? 

Reisen: Yes, just look at yourself! 

Nitori: ...? I don't feel sick. 
I guess I can run some tests later just in case. 

Reisen: [expression] ugh
... 
[expression] sad
**There was no quiver of deceit in her vocal waves.
[expression] sweat
**I guess she isn't lying.

Nitori: Hm... what am I missing? [leave] (end)
