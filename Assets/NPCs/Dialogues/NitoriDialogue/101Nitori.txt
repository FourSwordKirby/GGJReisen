Nitori: Hmm, I'm not making very much progress... 

Reisen: On recreating the storage unit? 

Nitori: Oh, it's the rabbit again. 

Didn't I tell you I'm in the middle of very important work? 

Reisen: **I should choose my words carefully...

Reisen: I doubt you'd be able to comprehend something as amazing as Lunarian science over a day. [science]
Nitori: You're awfully arrogant for a rabbit that only knows how to pound mochi. 
Reisen: I'll have you know I'm a moon rabbit. 
We're far superior to those silly bunnies you have on Earth. 
Nitori: Is... that so? You all look the same to me. 
Huh? Wait, then you can explain how that <b>simplification </b>phenomenon works right? 
Reisen: For the <b>Dimensionality Reducer</b>? Yeah of course! 
Nitori: Oh! So how does it work!? 
Reisen: Yeah, it... 
... 
[expression] worry
... *sweats* 

Nitori: I see Moon Rabbits are just as disappointing as Earth Rabbits... 

Reisen: No that's not it! It's just... not my field of expertise...

I'd be glad to tell you about the wave mathematics used in its moonlight power cells... 
But even I'm not sure how the data compression algorithm inside works... 
Nitori: ... Not interested. Water power already works at all times of the day. 
I don't need something that's obviously going to stop working when a new moon rolls around. 
*sigh* Back to square one, I guess. 
But still, a Lunarian, huh? 
Reisen: An alien to you, I suppose. 
Nitori: I might have some questions for you later. Let's keep in touch. 
Reisen: Oh?

You said you broke one of the contraptions in the village? 

Nitori: Huh? Oh, maybe? I don't know. 

Reisen: I figured I might as well ask, but... 

Are you the one responsible for this incident? 

Nitori: You were babbling something like that earlier too. 

What incident? I haven't done anything. 

Reisen: There's a <b>simplification </b>virus afflicting the whole village! 

Nitori: A virus? 

The humans looked healthy when I left this morning. 

Did something happen? 

Reisen: Yes, just look at yourself! 

Nitori: I don't feel sick. 

I guess I can run some tests when I get home just in case. 

Reisen: ... 

**There was no quiver of deceit in her vocal waves. 

**I guess she isn't lying.
