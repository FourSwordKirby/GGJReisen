Nitori: Thanks for bringing that magazine.
I figured out what I should do now.
I'm going to ask <i>that person</i> for help. 

Reisen: [expression] sweat
**Who's <i>that person</i>?
**Is that more censoring by the virus?

Nitori: You were interested in those <b>contraption</b>, right? 
For bringing me the magazine, how 'bout I give this? 

Reisen: [expression] sad
This is... some kind of scroll?

Nitori: Open it up.

Reisen: [expression] shock
This is a diagram of the <b>Dimensionality Reducer</b>!?

Nitori: The contraption, yeah!

Reisen: [expression] sad
But what kind of writing is this...? 

Nitori: That's the problem... 
I dug it up in our storage shed here, but I can't read it... 
Well, given how simple the diagram is, I doubt its usefulness.

Reisen: [expression] annoy
I'll take anything to get closer to solving this incident...

Nitori: Right. Good luck with whatever that is.
See ya. 

Reisen: [expression] sad
**Somehow, I feel unsatisfied with how that ended.
