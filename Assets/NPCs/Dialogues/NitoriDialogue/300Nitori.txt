Nitori: Thanks for bringing that magazine. 

I figured out what I should do now.

I'm going to ask "that person" for help. 

Anyways, you were interested in that contraption in the village, right? 

In exchange for bringing me the magazine, how 'bout I give this? 

Reisen: This is... some kind of scroll? 

Nitori: Open it up. 

Reisen: No way! This is a diagram of the <b>Dimensionality Reducer</b>? 

Nitori: The contraption, yeah! 

Reisen: But what kind of writing is this...? 

Nitori: That's the problem... 

I dug it up in our storage shed here, but I can't read it... 

Well, given how simple the diagram is, it's not useful to me anyways. 

I think it's some kind of user manual. 

Reisen: Huh. Well, even small hints should help...

Nitori:  Right, good luck with whatever you're up to.

See ya. 

Reisen: **... Somehow, I feel unsatisfied with how that ended.
