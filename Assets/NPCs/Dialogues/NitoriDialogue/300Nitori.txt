Nitori: Thanks for bringing that magazine. 

I figured out what I should do now to move forward. 

I'm going to pay that <b>person</b> a visit for help. 

You were interested in that contraption in the village, right? 

In exchange for bringing me the magazine, how about I give this? 

Reisen: This is... some kind of scroll? 

Nitori: Open it up. 

Reisen: No way! This is a diagram of the <b>Dimensionality Reducer</b>? 

Nitori: The contraption, yeah! 

Reisen: But what kind of writing is this...? 

Nitori: That's the problem... 

I dug it up in our storage shed here, but I can't read it... 

Well, given how simple the diagram is, it's not useful to me anyways. 

I think it's some kind of user manual. 

Reisen: Huh. Well, this should help with the investigation. 

Nitori:  Right, good luck with whatever that is. 

See ya. 

Reisen: **... Somehow, I feel unsatisfied with how that ended.
