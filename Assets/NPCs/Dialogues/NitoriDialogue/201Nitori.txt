//201 â€“ A Fair Trade 

Nitori: I'm not getting anywhere...
Hm? It's you again?
You don't need to keep checking on me.
I'm about to leave soon.
Reisen: **She's struggling with the storage box idea.
**Should I give her something?

Nitori: ... What is this? [elixir]
Reisen: It's a powerful elixir. Drink it. 
The incident this time is a wide spread virus.
You've already contracted it.
This should cure you.

Nitori: And you were the one calling me suspicious... 
Don't think I'm dumb enough to just believe you. 
Hmm... 

Reisen: [expression] sweat
**She's stirring the medicine with something...

Nitori: Wait, this is...!!
I'll take a sip!

Nitori: Whoa! What is that!? [smartphone]

Reisen: It's a Lunarian Smartphone. 
[expression] sweat
Maybe it'll help you with your slump?

Nitori: Let me see! Let me see! 

Reisen: [expression] sad
**I still don't know why a Lunarian smartphone is here... 
**Did another <b>Moon Rabbit</b> drop it recently? 

Nitori: Wow, this is amazing!
Hey, do you want to trade for this? 

Reisen: [expression] sweat
Uh, I'm not sure if I should be trading-

Nitori: You were interested in the <b>contraptions</b>, right?
How about I trade you this?

Reisen: [expression] sad
This is... some kind of scroll?

Nitori: Open it up.

Reisen: [expression] shock
This is a diagram of the <b>Dimensionality Reducer</b>!?

Nitori: The contraption, yeah!

Reisen: [expression] sad
But what kind of writing is this...? 

Nitori: That's the problem... 
I dug it up in our storage shed here, but I can't read it... 
Well, given how simple the diagram is, I doubt its usefulness.

Reisen: [expression] annoy
I'll take anything to get closer to solving this incident...
[expression] normal
Ok, I'll trade.

Nitori: Yay! I'm gonna get working on this phone right away.

Reisen: [expression] sad
**Was it really a good idea to give it to her...? 

(end)


Nitori: A magazine? [magazine]
Reisen: Yeah, from the Outside World.
[expression] sweat
Maybe it'll help with your slump?

Nitori: Hmm...? It's a technology magazine.
This is neat stuff, but it's not really... 
Oh huh, this pair of ear muffs is named after two people. 
Maybe what I need is a brainstorming session...
I have an idea.
