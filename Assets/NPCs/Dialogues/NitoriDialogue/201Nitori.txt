//201 â€“ A Fair Trade 

Nitori: It's no good. I'm not getting anywhere...
Hm? It's you again?
You don't need to keep checking on me.
I'm about to quit soon.
Reisen: **They seem to be struggling.
**Should I give her something?

Nitori: ... What is this? [elixir]
Reisen: It's a powerful elixir. Drink it. 
You don't see the incident happening around you because you've already been infected by it. 
Nitori: First, you were calling me suspicious... 
Don't think I'm dumb enough to take your words at face value. 
Hmm... 
Reisen: ... What are those cubes you just brought out? 
Nitori: Cubes? These are tools to help me perform a litmus test. 
... Wait, this is... !! 
Let me take a sip!

Nitori: Whoa! What is that!? [smartphone]
Reisen: It's a Lunarian Smartphone. 
I figured it might help you with your slump. 
Nitori: Let me see! Let me see! 
Reisen: **I still don't know what's that doing here... 
**Did another rabbit drop it during the invasion of Gensokyo? 
Nitori: Wow, this is amazing. 
Hey, do you want to trade for this? 
Reisen: Huh!? Uh, I'm not sure if I should be trading someone's-
Nitori: You were interested in that contraption in the village, right? 
How about I trade you this? 
Reisen: This is... some kind of scroll? 
Nitori: Open it up. 
Reisen: No way! This is a diagram of the <b>Dimensionality Reducer</b>? 
Nitori: The contraption, yeah! 
Reisen: But what kind of writing is this...? 
Nitori: That's the problem... 
I dug it up in our storage shed here, but I can't read it... 
Well, given how simple the diagram is, it's not useful to me anyways. 
I think it's some kind of user manual. 
Reisen: Hm, if it can help resolve the incident... 
Alright, sure, I'll trade. 
Nitori: Yay! I'm gonna get working on this phone right away. 
Reisen: **Was it really a good idea to give it to her...?

Nitori: A magazine?  [magazine]
Reisen: Yeah, from the Outside World it looks like. 
I figured it would help with your slump. 
Nitori: Hmm...? Oh, it's a technology magazine. 
This is neat stuff, but it's not really... 
Oh huh, this pair of ear muffs seems to be named after two people. 
... Maybe what I actually need is a brainstorming session.
