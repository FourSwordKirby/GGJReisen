// 301 â€“ Witch of the Forest 

Nitori: Thanks for bringing that magazine. 

I figured out what I should do now.

I'm going to ask <b>Marisa</b> to help figure out the <b>simplification</b> process. 

Reisen: Marisa? That quirky human magician in the Forest of Magic? 

Nitori: Yep, she's actually pretty sharp when it comes to experimentation. 

Reisen: I don't remember her being very smart. 

Nitori: She's always stealing stuff and acting like a ditz, so it's hard to imagine. 

But, did you know? She doesn't have a master. A magician without a master. 

Imagine figuring out <b>Magic</b> all by yourself. No teacher or text book to teach you. 

She wrote her own spells and grimoires through trial and error. 

We <b>Kappa</b> don't really understand <b>Magic</b>. 

But I can appreciate the scientific method when I see it. 

Hate to admit it, but she's pretty good for a <b>human</b>. 

Reisen: **Wah! What's happening!?
