// 301 â€“ Witch of the Forest 

Nitori: Thanks for bringing that magazine. 
I figured out what I should do now.
I'm going to ask <b>Marisa</b> to help figure out the <b>simplification</b> process. 

Reisen: [expression] shock
Marisa!?
That quirky human magician in the Forest of Magic? 

Nitori: Yep, she's pretty sharp when it comes to experimentation. 

Reisen: [expression] sad
I don't remember her being very smart. 

Nitori: She's always acting like a ditz, so it's hard to imagine. 
But, did you know?
She doesn't have a master. A magician without a master. 
Imagine figuring out <b>Magic</b> all by yourself.
No teacher or text book to teach you. 
She wrote her own spells and grimoires through trial and error. 
We <b>Kappa</b> don't really understand <b>Magic</b>. 
But I can appreciate the scientific method when I see it. 
Hate to admit it, but she's pretty good for a <b>human</b>. 

Reisen: [expression] shock
**Wah! What's happening!?
