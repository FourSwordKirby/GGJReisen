Nitori: You said you were a Lunarian, right? 

Reisen: [expression] sad
Ex-Lunarian. 

Nitori: What's your name? 
I'm <b>Nitori Kawashiro</b>.
I'm a Kappa, in case that's a foreign concept to ya. 

Reisen: [expression] normal
Reisen Udonge'in Inaba. 
[expression] annoy
I know what a Kappa is.
I've been around for several decades already. 

Nitori: Is that so?
I've never seen you around before. 

Reisen: [expression] sad
I try to live a quiet life. 

Nitori: Well, show me Lunarian tech some time, okay? 
I doubt it holds a candle to Kappa technology...
But I've always been curious.  

Reisen: [expression] heh
Heh, I guess turtles in a well think they're the best in the world. 
[expression] sad
... Hm? 
[expression] sweat
I recall master saying that Kappa were a proud species. 
Your tech isn't anywhere close to the moon's...
But you have better stuff than the majority of Gensokyo. 
Why are you turning to Marisa for help? 
What about the rest of your Kappa friends? 

Nitori: I thought I already mentioned this...
But I'd prefer to claim this achievement for myself. 
From a partnership standpoint, Marisa's easy to negotiate with.
You have no idea how hard it is to patent something co-developed by Kappa... 

Reisen: [expression] sad
Interesting. Moon rabbits are pretty carefree... 
[expression] normal
We share stuff all the time on the psychic network. 

Nitori: Well, that's one reason. 
But the other is really in credit to Marisa. 
She's a genius in her own way. 
Sometimes, you need an <b>outside</b> perspective to make progress. 
Don't get me wrong, brainstorming with other Kappa is great. 
But when you really want to push the boundary...
You'll need inspiration from all perspectives, even if they're a human. 

Reisen: [expression] sad
I'm not sure if I could trust a human... 

Nitori: And that's why Lunar tech is bound to be leaps behind Kappa tech.
If you hide in a bubble, you'll never gain anything new. 

Reisen: [expression] annoy
... I guess I can't disagree.

Nitori:
Kappa have always been friends with the humans.
We exchange ideas all the time.
If you're up for it, we can share ideas too.
Just let me know. And bring your coolest Lunar tech!

Reisen: [expression] shock
**Whoa, a really big Personality Shard manifested!
