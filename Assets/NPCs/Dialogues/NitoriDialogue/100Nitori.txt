 //100 â€“ <b>Dimensionality Reducer</b>s 

Nitori: Perfectly honest, I don't know much about the <b>contraptions</b>. 

Reisen: You little! 

Nitori: Hold on. The reason I don't is because it's <b>Lunarian Technology</b>. 

Reisen: **Well, I knew that much. 

Nitori: I found a bunch of them in the village this morning at sunrise. 

They looked interesting, so I tried tinkering with one. 

Reisen: Oh, so you were the one fiddling with it. 

Nitori: Huh? Yeah, I guess so? I was just curious what they did. 

It turns out, they're just fancy <b>storage boxes</b>. 

But the catch is, they can hold more stuff inside than their physical size. 

Now the rest is guesswork, but I think they do that by "<b>simplifying</b>" the object to store. 

There's less "information" in simple objects,

So they're able to fit more things than usual into the same space. 

Reisen: **Is that how a <b>Dimensionality Reducer</b> works? 

**I knew they were supersized metaphysical containers, but not the details... 

Nitori: In any case, one of them is unusable now. 

Reisen: Huh? Why's that? 

Nitori: I might've clipped something I shouldn't have while tinkering. 

It made a weird sound, and then powered down. 

Reisen: Did you break it...? 

Nitori: Beats me. 

The humans in the village were waking up at that point, so I ditched. 

In the meantime, I've been thinking about how to recreate one.

Imagine being able to fit a whole harvest of cucumbers in a single refrigerator!

Oh, don't tell the other <b>Kappa</b> yet. 

Reisen: **A personality shard just manifested!
