 //100 â€“ <b>Dimensionality Reducer</b>s 

Nitori: So, to be perfectly honest...
I don't know much about those <b>contraptions</b>. 

Reisen: [expression] angry
You little! 

Nitori: Hold on.
The reason I don't is because they're <b>Lunarian Technology</b>. 

Reisen: [expression] sad
**Well, I knew that much. 

Nitori: They were already there when I arrived early this morning.
I was curious, so I tinkered with the one near the school.
It turns out, they're just <b>storage boxes</b>.
But the cool part is...
They can hold more stuff inside than their physical size suggests!

Reisen: [expression] annoy
**Yep. I knew that already.

Nitori:
Now I'm just guessing, but...
I think they work by "<b>simplifying</b>" the objects they store. 
There's less "information" in simple objects...
So these boxes can fit more things than usual in the same volume. 

Reisen: [expression] shock
**Is that how a <b>Dimensionality Reducer</b> works? 
[expression] sad
**I knew they were supersized metaphysical containers...
[expression] ugh
**But not how they actually worked.
[expression] normal
**I wonder if the <b>simplifying</b> is related to the virus...

Nitori: In any case, the one at the school is unusable now. 

Reisen: [expression] sweat
Huh? Why's that?

Nitori: I might've clipped something bad while tinkering. 

It made a weird sound.

Reisen: [expression] sad
**But, it was working when I tried it...
[expression] annoy
Did you trigger something...? 

Nitori: Beats me. 
The humans were waking up at that point, so I ditched.
In the meantime, I've been thinking about how to recreate one.
I could fit a whole harvest of cucumbers into one box if I had one!
Oh, but don't tell the other <b>Kappa</b> about that yet.

Reisen: [expression] shock
**A personality shard just manifested!
