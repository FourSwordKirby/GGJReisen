Nitori: So this is what you meant by incident... 
... shoot, did I cause this? 

Reisen: [expression] sweat
By breaking the <b>Dimensionality Reducer</b>?
Yeah, maybe.

Nitori: No, I uh...
That couldn't have caused something this bad, right?
Haha...

Reisen: [expression] sad
Well there's no helping it now...
The remaining mystery is why they were here in the first place.
[expression] normal
Don't worry, I'll take care of this. 
As an ex-Lunarian.
