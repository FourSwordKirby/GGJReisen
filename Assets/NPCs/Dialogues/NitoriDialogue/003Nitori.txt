Reisen: It's a powerful elixir. Drink it. 
The incident this time is a wide spread virus.
You've already contracted it.
This should cure you.

Don't think I'm dumb enough to just believe you. 
Hmm...

Is this yours?

This, uh, sure is mine! Yeah!
Thanks for finding it!

Reisen: [expression] sweat
Where did you get it from? 

Nitori: Geh.

Reisen: [expression] ugh
Geh?

Nitori: A-ah, you know.
I found it discarded along the river. 
It looked interesting, so I picked it up.
I guess I dropped it without realizing!
Whoops, haha! Imagine that!
