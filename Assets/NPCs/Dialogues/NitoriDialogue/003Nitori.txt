Nitori: ... What is this? [elixir]
Reisen: It's a powerful elixir. Drink it. 
You don't see the incident happening around you because you've already been infected by it. 
Nitori: First, you were calling me suspicious... 
Don't think I'm dumb enough to take your words at face value. 
Hmm... 
Reisen: ... What are those cubes you just brought out? 
Nitori: Cubes? These are tools to help me perform a litmus test. 
... Wait, this is... !!
Let me take a sip!

Nitori: This is...! [smartphone]
Reisen: This was found near the contraption at the school. 
Nitori: Oh! Oh, yeah! Thanks for finding it! 
Reisen: Where did you get that from? 
Nitori: Geh.  
Reisen: Geh? 
Nitori: A-ah, you know. I found it discarded along the river stream. 
It looked interesting, so I was going to disassemble it. 
But I guess I dropped it! Whoops, imagine that! 
Reisen: Hey, wait, so it's not yours- 
Nitori: Ah, you wanted to hear about the contraption, right? Right?

Reisen: **This stupid cube really... 
Nitori: It's hard to do any <b>engineering</b> without one of these puppies, yeah? 
Reisen: Sure... 
So, what do you know about the <b>contraption</b>? 
Nitori: Right, that's what you wanted to know about.
