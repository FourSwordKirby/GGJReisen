Nitori: Oh right, thanks for bringing me that magazine. 

You were interested in that contraption in the village, right? 

In exchange for bringing me the magazine, how about I give you this? 

Reisen: This is... some kind of scroll? 

Nitori: Open it up. 

Reisen: No way! This is a diagram of the <b>Dimensionality Reducer</b>? 

Nitori: The contraption, yeah! 

Reisen: But what kind of writing is this...? 

Nitori: That's the problem... 

I dug it up in our storage shed here, but I can't read it... 

Well, given how simple the diagram is, it's not useful to me anyways. 

I think it's some kind of user manual. 

Reisen: Huh. Well, even small hints should help...

Nitori: Investigation? Whoa! 

Why's everything so blocky!?
