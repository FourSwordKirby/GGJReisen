Nitori: Thanks for bringing me that magazine. 
In exchange, how about I give you this?
You were interested in that contraption in the village, right? 

Reisen: [expression] sad
This is... some kind of scroll?

Nitori: Open it up. 

Reisen: [expression] shock
This is a diagram of the <b>Dimensionality Reducer</b>!?

Nitori: The contraption, yeah!

Reisen: [expression] sad
But what kind of writing is this...? 

Nitori: That's the problem... 
I dug it up in our storage shed here, but I can't read it... 
Well, given how simple the diagram is, I doubt its usefulness.

Reisen: [expression] annoy
I'll take anything to get closer to solving this incident...

Nitori: Incident?
Whoa!
Why's everything so blocky!? 

Reisen: [expression] shock
**Did you only just notice!?
