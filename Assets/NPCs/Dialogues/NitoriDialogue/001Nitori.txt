Reisen: **Now that I think about, this person recognized me as a Youaki, didn't they? 

**Maybe they aren't human... 

Nitori: You're still poking around? 

Reisen: What are you doing in an abandoned area like this? 

Nitori: <b>Very important work.</b> 

Reisen: Sounds suspicious... 

Nitori: Look, I'm building <b>something</b>. It might be a huge breakthrough for all I know. 

I didn't want any of <b>the other people</b> to find out, so I'm doing it out here. 

Reisen: Is that so? When you put it like that, I almost want to root for you. 

But wait, that doesn't make you any less suspicious.  

Nitori: I can guarantee you it's nothing dangerous... 

I found an <b>object</b> which inspired me to try <b>something</b> with this other <b>thing</b>. 

And if it works, I can build that into a <b>device</b>, and attach it to another <b>object</b>. 

The resulting tool will be very useful for <b>doing stuff. </b>

See, harmless, right? 

Reisen: No, I didn't understand a word of that... 

Nitori: Well, I figured as much. 

Reisen: I don't think anyone would understand an explanation as vague as that. 

**Is this an effect of the virus?
