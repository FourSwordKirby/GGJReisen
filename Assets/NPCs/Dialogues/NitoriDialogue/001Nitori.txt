**Now that I think about...
**This person recognized me as a Youaki, didn't they?
**Maybe they aren't human... 

Nitori: You're still poking around?

Reisen: [expression] normal
What are you doing in an abandoned area like this? 

Nitori: Very important work.

Reisen: [expression] annoy
Sounds suspicious... 

Nitori: Look, I'm building something.
It might be a huge breakthrough for all I know.
I didn't want my peers to find out, so I'm out here. 

Reisen: [expression] sweat
When you put it like that, I almost want to root for you.
[expression] ugh
But wait, that doesn't make you any less suspicious.

Nitori: I guarantee you it's nothing dangerous... 
I'm trying to combine this <i>thing</i> with this other <i>thing</i>. 
If it works, I can build a <i>thing</i> to attach to another <i>thing</i>.
The resulting <i>thing</i> will be very useful.
See, harmless, right? 

Reisen: [expression] annoy
No, I didn't understand a word of that... 

Nitori: Well, I figured as much. 

Reisen: [expression] angry
Nobody could understand an explanation that vague.

Nitori: Huh? I was pretty specific though...

Reisen: [expression] sad
**She said <i>thing</i> a bunch of times.
**Is the virus censoring her speech?
