Thanks for bringing it! 

Reisen: [expression] sweat
No problem...
[expression] sad
**If she ordered medicine before, I probably know her...
**Though, she probably doesn't recognize me without my usual disguise.
[expression] sweat
**Wait... I'm not disguised as a human right now.

Kosuzu: Ah, my throat feels much better... Back to work!

Reisen: Hey, aren't you be scared of me?

Kosuzu: Am I supposed to be?

Reisen: [expression] sad
Well, I suppose you don't have to be...

Kosuzu: I treat all my customers with respect!
So long as you treat my wares with respect too!

Reisen: [expression] sad
**Strange, does she not see me as a <b>youkai</b>?
**Is this also a part of the <b>virus</b>?
**Hold on, I should know this person...
**Did I sell medicine to someone who wasn't afraid of Youkai?

Kosuzu: Hmm, I was supposed to deliver this to someone.
But I can't leave the shop right now...
Hey miss, could you do me a favor?

Reisen: **It's no good... I never talked much to my customers.
**Maybe if she wasn't a cube I would know who she is.
**I think...

Kosuzu: Hey miss?

Reisen: [expression] shock
Huh?
[expression] sweat
Ah, yeah sure. What did you say?

Kosuzu: Great! Please deliver this <b>history book</b> for me!

Reisen: [expression] happy
Yeah of course!
[expression] shock
Wait, what did I just agree to!?

Kosuzu: The recipient is...
...Huh? I don't remember.
Did the cough get to me...?
Well, in any case, not many people borrow books these days.
I'm sure if you ask around, you'll find the right person!

Reisen: **What a ridiculous request!
