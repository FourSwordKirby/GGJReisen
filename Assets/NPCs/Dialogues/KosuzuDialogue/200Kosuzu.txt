Kosuzu: Hey if you have <i>things</i> that you don't need...
We can buy them off you too!

Reisen: [expression] sweat
What kinds of things are you talking about?

Kosuzu: Umm, you know, <i>things!</i>

Reisen: [expression] annoy
**No. I don't know.

Kosuzu: Sorry, I'm feeling a little dizzy.
Is this a side-effect of the cough earlier?

Reisen: [expression] normal
**Do I have something for her?

Kosuzu: Oh? What's this? [elixir]

Reisen: It's medicine to cure any symptoms that came with the cough.

Kosuzu: Oh, thanks Miss Medicine Peddler!
My head's been feeling a bit hazy today.
I guess the cough made me light headed.

Kosuzu: Oh? This is a... [magazine]
Reisen: It's a magazine written in a language I don't know.
Kosuzu: Hmm, this seems to be German?
Reisen: [expression] sweat
You can read it?

Kosuzu: Yeah. It's a technology magazine from the Outside world.
This is neat. We can buy this off your hands.
Here's your payment.

Reisen: **Huh, she dropped a <b>Personality Shard</b>. 

Kosuzu: Oh right, this is a <b>book shop</b>!

Reisen: [expression] ugh
No kidding...

Kosuzu: Ahaha, sorry. I'm feeling a bit off today.
It's like... I keep forgetting a lot of things.
And I have these random bursts where I remember what I forgot.

Reisen: [expression] sad
**That must be because of the Lunarian <b>virus</b>...

Kosuzu: Whoa! How'd you come into possession of that!? [scroll]

Reisen: [expression] shock
Huh? I uh-

Kosuzu: Do you need it!? I'll buy it right now! How much!?

Reisen: [expression] sweat
Do you know what this is?

Kosuzu: Err, I mean...
It's looks like a rare scroll.
It's a very valuable piece of literary work. Yes.

Reisen: **This scroll is about the <b>Dimensionality Reducers</b>.
**But it's written by Youkai, in a language I don't know.
**Did she pick up on that somehow?

Kosuzu: So, uh, are you willing to sell it, dear customer?

Reisen: [expression] sad
Maybe later. I need it right now.

Kosuzu: Aww... Could I... see it though?

Reisen: [expression] sweat
I suppose so.

Kosuzu: Yay!
Wait my dizzy spell just cleared up all of a sudden!
This is <b>Suzunaan</b>, the local <b>book shop</b>!
