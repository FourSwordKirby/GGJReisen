Reisen: I delivered the <b>history book</b>.

Kosuzu: Awesome! Thanks!
And thanks again for that cough medicine earlier!

Reisen: [expression] sad
Yeah, no problem...

Kosuzu: Hey, I'm really bored right now. 
They say that being bored is a blessing in disguise. 
But in the Outside World, there's a youkai known as the Boogeyman.
The Boogeyman comes for children who have too much free time. 
Heehee, maybe I should keep being bored then? 
What do you think?

Reisen: [expression] sad
**In order to manifest a <b>Personality Shard</b>...
**I need to direct the conversation to reveal their personality.
[expression] sweat
**I should choose my words carefully.

[choice] [Prefer boredom over working. | work] [Boredom is opportunity. | opportunity] [No Youkai please... | youkai] [Let me think. | leave]


Reisen: If you're bored, that means you have free time from work. [work]
[expression] annoy
I have to work <i>very hard</i> every day.
[expression] sad
Sometimes, I envy people who have time to do other things. 

Kosuzu: Hmm, I have to run this shop every day too. 
It's not like I don't get what you mean, but... 
Don'tcha wish that things were more exciting? 
If all you think about is work, work, work...
Is there any meaning to life?
There's nothing special to a life like that.

Reisen: [expression] normal
There's no shame in following your assigned duties.
[expression] sad
The rabbits on the moon are content to pound mochi all day...
All in order to atone for their master's sins.

Kosuzu: Haha, I can't help but pity those rabbits... 

Reisen: [expression] ugh
**I seem to have hit the wrong note.
**Talking sure is exhausting...

Reisen: I see boredom as an opportunity to try new things. [opportunity]
[expression] annoy
Well, in my case, I need to be careful...
My master has a lot of strict rules on what I can do...

Kosuzu: But there's hardly anything to around here!

Reisen: [expression] normal
I'm sure you can find something if you try.
[expression] sad
I don't have much free time, so I don't get to try many things...
[expression] happy
But like... I guess I'd want to try making a medicine of my own.
One without help from my master.

Kosuzu: Hehh, that sounds exciting.
Do show me if you make something! 

Reisen: [expression] happy
...
[expression] shock
**I ended up talking more about myself than she did!

Reisen: [expression] sweat [youkai]
What is this Boogeyman business...?
[expression] sad
It sounds awful that you could get attacked for having free time.
Are people in the Outside World even more overworked than moon rabbits?
[expression] ugh
I'd rather not deal with more random Youkai attacks...

Kosuzu: "More Youkai Attacks"!?
You've been attacked before!?
How are you still alive?

Reisen: [expression] shock
A-ah, yeah.
[expression] heh
Heh, yeah, it wasn't a big deal.
I've knocked out plenty of Youkai before.
I once beat up a vampire in her own home.
[expression] annoy
**Well, I got trashed the first time...

Kosuzu: Wow, I didn't know medicine peddlers could be so awesome!
Please come visit the shop more often!
I'd love to hear more of your stories!

Reisen: [expression] shock
Huh? Uh, sure...

Kosuzu: So you, like, must know their weak points and stuff, right?
I've been studying and reading a lot about Youkai...
From uh... special Youkai books.
There's so much more to Youkai beyond what everyone talks about!
Like the schemes they have going behind human backs...
Getting caught up in one sounds really exciting!
Ah, not saying that I want to be caught up in one.
That'd be terrifying. 
But you know, I can't help but wonder!

Reisen: [expression] sweat
**Is she a... Youkai enthusiast...?
**Did such humans exist...?
[expression] shock
**Another personality shard!
