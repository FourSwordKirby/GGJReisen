Kosuzu: Hey, thanks for that coughing medicine earlier! 
I’m really bored right now. 
Some people say that being able to feel bored is a blessing in disguise. 
But in the west, there’s a youkai known as the Boogeyman that comes children who have too much free time. 
Heh heh, maybe I should keep being bored then? 
What do you think? 
Reisen: **I should choose my words carefully.

[choice] [Would prefer being bored over working. | work] [I see boredom as an opportunity. | opportunity] [I’d rather not get attacked by Youkai again. | youkai] [Give me a moment to think. | leave]
    
Reisen: If you’re bored, that means you have the luxury of free time from work. [work]
I have to work every day. Sometimes, I envy you people who have time to do other things. 
Kosuzu: Hmm, I have to run this shop every day too. 
It’s not like I don’t get what you mean, but… 
Don’t you kinda wish that things could be more exciting sometimes? 
If all you think about is work, work, work, is there any meaning to life? 
You’d just be repeating what everyone else before you has done. 
Reisen: There is no shame in carrying out your assigned duties. 
Have you heard? The rabbits on the moon are content to pound mochi all day, in order to atone for their master’s sins. 
Kosuzu: Haha, I can’t help but pity those rabbits… 
Reisen: **I seem to have hit the wrong note. Talking to humans is exhausting...

Reisen: I see boredom as an opportunity to try new things. [opportunity]
Well, in my case, I need to be careful to only try things that aren’t against my master’s strict rules… 
Kosuzu: Ah, but there’s not much to do around here, is there? 
Reisen: I’m sure you can find something if you try. 
I don’t have very much free time, so I don’t get to experiment very often. 
But if I did, I’d try to make a medicine on my own without help from my master. 
Kosuzu: Heh, that sounds exciting. Do show me if you make something! 
Reisen: **I ended up talking more about myself than she did.

Reisen: It sounds awful that a Youkai would attack when somebody was finally able to have time to relax. [youkai]
I’d really rather not have to deal with more random attacks… 
Kosuzu: Huh!? You’ve been attacked before? How are you still alive? 
Reisen: A-ah, yeah. It was just a small youkai though. I managed to chase it off with some of the aromatics I carry though. 
**That’s a lie. That was a full-on battle with a whimsical vampire...
Kosuzu: Wow, I didn’t know medicine peddlers could be so awesome! 
There’s so much more to Youkai beyond what the human village is willing to talk about. 
Getting caught up in a Youkai scheme of some sort, now that would be really exciting. 
Ah, not saying that I want to be caught up in one, that’d be terrifying. 
But you know, I can’t help but wonder! 
Reisen: **Hm? Another personality shard!
