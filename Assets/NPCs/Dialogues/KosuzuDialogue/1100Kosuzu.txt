Why's everything so cube-y now!
Was I one of those cube things too!?

Reisen: [expression] sweat
Yes, the elixir you just drank cured you...

Kosuzu: Wow, jee thanks!
Nice bunny ear head band. It’s very cute!

Reisen: [expression] annoy
**I can’t tell her these are real...

Kosuzu: Wow this is so bizarre.

I have to find Reimu!
... Or maybe this is my chance to try incident solving?
M-maybe I can figure this myself!
Where are my Youma books...

Reisen: [expression] ugh
**Uh... Did I make a mistake giving her the elixir?
