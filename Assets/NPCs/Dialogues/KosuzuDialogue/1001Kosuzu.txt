Kosuzu: So... about that scroll

Reisen: [expression] sweat
Sure, here it is.
Why did you want to see it so badly?

Kosuzu: Well... it's a special kind of scroll, ya know?
But the thing is, I can read it!
Check this out!
"Quickstart Guide - <b>Dimensionality Reducer</b> Model QZ3"

Reisen: [expression] shock
You're... actually reading it!

Kosuzu: Yup, isn't that cool?
Ah, but even though I can read it... 
The content doesn't make any sense to me.

Reisen: [expression] normal
What does it say?

Kosuzu: Something about <b>reduced dimensionality</b> storage?
"By lowering the 'complexity' of an object..."
"The device is able to fit more objects inside than normal."

Reisen: [expression] sweat
**Okay, that confirms what I learned earlier...

Kosuzu: "Damage to the device could cause a <b>simplification leakage</b>."
"Objects around the leak will lose their complexity and deform..."
"Check for malfunctioning parts frequently..."

Reisen: [expression] shock
...
[expression] sad
**<b>Simplification leakage</b>...
**That must be the true nature of this <b>virus</b>...

Kosuzu: "The <b>simplification algorithm</b> is a reversible process..."
"When an object is placed inside, it is <b>simplified</b>..."
"The inverse process, <b>feature reconstruction</b>, restores the object when removed."
"This happens automatically, or can be manually triggered..."
Agh! I give up!
This is too complicated. I have no idea what it's talking about...
In the first place, what is this device even?

Reisen: [expression] shock
There's a reversal process!
That means we can fix this incident!
[expression] happy
Thank you, Miss Motoori!

Kosuzu: Huh?
Um... You're welcome?
