Reisen: What happened here? 

These shapes… seem nostalgic for some reason. 

Is this technology from the Lunar Capital on the moon? 

[instruction] EnterOrb (yin yang orb gameobject is “fixed”, orb is animated to come in from off screen, A yin-yang orb zooms into view, hovering next to Reisen. From the orb, a voice speaks out. ) 

Reimu: Oh? You’re the moon rabbit from the bamboo forest, aren’t you? 

Reisen: Huh? This voice… is that the shrine maiden? 

Reimu: Ah, yeah. It’s me Reimu. You came at a convenient time. 

Can you clean up this mess? 

Reisen: Clean up? Is this YOUR mess? 

Reimu: It’s nothing I did. In fact, the fault entirely lies with you. 

Your entourage from the Lunar Capital started something again. Yukari and I are busy handling them. 

Reisen: Hold on, my master wouldn’t start something as random as- 

Reimu: No, Eirin is also helping us right now. 

It’s those princesses from the moon and Junko that have utterly screwed over Gensokyo right now. 

There’s no time to explain everything, but we need someone on Earth to stabilize the human village. 

And quickly too. 

Reisen: Can’t you get someone else?

Yukari: Hi hi! Is this the moon rabbit on the other end? 

Reisen: Yes, this is she. Who is this? 

Yukari: Oh my, you remembered the shrine maiden but not me? 

I’ll have you know I helped created this paradise you now call home, you know~ 

[choice] [The youkai sage, Yukari?  | correct] [The magician from the forest, Marisa?   | wrong]

Yukari: Bingo! And with that you’ve passed part one of your citizenship test. [correct] (103)

Yukari: Boo, you’ll have to brush up on your Gensokyo history if you want to live here, moon rabbit. [wrong]

Yukari: I am Yukari, the youkai sage who oversees the Gensokyo boundary. I’m sure you’ve heard of me. (103)



Yukari: Now listen carefully little rabbit. We’re almost out of time. [103]

Currently, a lunar virus has eradicated the boundary of simplicity and complexity, <b>reducing all life into those simple gray cubes </b> you see around you.

In fact, that odd pile of blocks over there is actually one of the towns folks. -this line might need to be edited-

At the current rate, all humans will merge into the landscape, becoming lifeless blocks of matter. 

And once the humans are gone, the entirety of Gensokyo will cease to be. 



Now as part of your citizenship test… 

You have to make sure the humans stay cognizant of their complex individuality. 

As you do, <b>Personality Shards</b> will manifest. Collect as many of these as you can. 

With enough of them, we’ll be able to overturn the virus and restore the town. 

Go around and <b>talk to the humans. </b>

Make them recall their names, their pasts, and their emotions. 

As you talk to people, you will discover they are all connected in complex ways. 

<b>Keep talking as much as you can!</b> Do your best to figure out how they relate and surface the full force of their personalities. 

<b>You will maximize the Personality Shards collected if you can unravel each person’s full story. </b>

Good luck! If you fail this, then our frontline war here against the Lunarians will be for naught!

Reisen: This is the work of a virus? 

Wait a minute, the medicine I packed today had several elixirs, didn’t it? 

Darn, there’s only two in here. 

I guess I can use these on the people that I think would be most helpful to me. 

Oh? There’s also some cough medicine in here. 

I think this was supposed to go to the family that owns the book store? 

…Shoot, these buildings all look the same. Which one is the book store?
