Akyu: "Am I dreaming? Or seeing nothing?" 
There was a song like that, wasn't there...? 

Reisen: [expression] happy
Hello.

Akyu: Good afternoon, Miss Reisen.
Akyu: I must be rather lucky today to finally meet the elusive youkai rabbit. 

Reisen: [expression] sad
Hm? We talked earlier today, didn't we? 

Akyu: Oh, is that so? My apologies. 
It felt like such a distant time ago, I wasn't sure if we had met in this lifetime. 

Reisen: [expression] ugh
I'm pretty sure it was less than 20 minutes ago...

Akyu: You must forgive me. My memory is in shambles today. 
Whether something had happened 10 minutes ago or 1000 years ago... 
They all feel equally close and distant... 

Reisen: [expression] sweat
Are you okay? That sounds rather bad.
[expression] shock
^^Wait what? Memories from 1000 years ago!? 

Akyu: Yes, I am a special descendant of the <b>Hieda</b> house. 
I am this era's <b>Child of Miare</b>. 
The reincarnation of the Hieda no Are, who reappears every hundred years. 
I serve to write the <b>Gensokyo Chronicle</b>. 
For that duty, I have been gifted the ability to remember all my past lives. 

Reisen: [expression] normal
That's rather convenient. 
[expression] sweat
For a normal human, that's basically one step short of immortality. 

Reisen: [expression] shock
Akyu: Yes! It is pretty amazing! 
... Or, maybe not. 

Reisen: [expression] normal
Akyu: As many memories I have of being proud of this ability, 
There are equal number of bitter moments where I have cursed this fate. 
How did the current generation me feel about it? 
I don't remember. 

Reisen: [expression] sweat
What does that mean? 

Akyu: I am a reincarnation of Hieda no Are, not the same person. 
I carry 10 people's worth of memories. 
Normally, the older memories feel very distant.... 
And I can say, "those are my ancestor's memories, not mine." 
But right now... 
I feel that my past emotions and memories have all blended together... 
Which generation of memories belong to <b>me</b>? 
If we had talked just yesterday, am I speaking the same way today?
Or is it the me from 1000 years ago speaking right now? 
I don't know... 
And that thought scares me... 

Reisen: [expression] sad
I'm... sorry to hear that...
