 

Akyu: I should really go thank Kosuzu at the book shop too. 

I'm probably being overly sentimental here, 

but it truly was a blessing to have met her. 

In the past, the Children of Miare always had good relations with that book shop. 

But it was truly a coincidence that in this generation, 

That the bookshop's daughter and I were of similar age. 

Kosuzu's a very good friend. 

Without her, I would've never had the idea to write mystery novels. 

Reisen: **... I'm somewhat jealous...
