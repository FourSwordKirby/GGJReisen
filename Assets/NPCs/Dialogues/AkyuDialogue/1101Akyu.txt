Akyu: Reisen! 

Reisen: [expression] sweat
Yes?

Akyu: I just remembered you were doing book deliveries earlier.

Reisen: [expression] annoy
Uh, yeah, I did do that, didn't I?

Akyu: How convenient, could I trouble you with a book delivery?

Reisen: [expression] angry
No!
[expression] happy
This time I'm paying attention!

Akyu: Oh... I see.
And here, I thought you were trying to turn a new leaf too...
Maybe you weren't as nice as I thought...

Reisen: [expression] sweat
...

Akyu: I may not live for very long...
But I'll definitely remember this for the rest of my life...
And in my next life too...
And the one after that as well.

Reisen: [expression] annoy
Okay, I get it...
What's the book you need delivered...

Akyu: Excellent!
This is an old encyclopedia that I had acquired. 
It contains entries on many <b>Youkai</b> and methods of dealing with them. 
I've finished transcribing what I need from it. 
A <b>school teacher</b> in the village was asking to borrow it. 
Can you bring this to them? 

Reisen: [expression] sweat
A <b>school teacher</b>? 
[expression] sad
**I think one of the cubes said she was a <b>school teacher</b>.
[expression] happy
Sure, I will try.
