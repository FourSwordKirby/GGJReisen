Akyu: ... 

Reisen: How do you feel? 

Akyu: Yes! I think that did the trick. 

My name is <b>Hieda no Akyu</b>, the ninth Child of Miare. 

Oh phew, now that I think about it, the way I was talking was way outdated, wasn't it? 

Reisen: **Wow, what a dramatic shift in personality. 

Akyu: Please let Miss Yagokoro know I am eternally grateful. 

And also, thank you Reisen for your help. 

I always knew you were different from other Youkai rabbits. 

But it still surprises me how willing you are to help humans. 

Reisen: I have my reasons. 

Akyu: ... 

Well, I've gotten the sense that you're not a social type to begin with. 

So I'll reign in my curiosity for now. 

Please take care. 

And let me know if you ever feel like chatting. 

I really would love to learn more about our village's elusive medicine peddler. 

Reisen: ... I'll consider it. 

So long as my master permits.
