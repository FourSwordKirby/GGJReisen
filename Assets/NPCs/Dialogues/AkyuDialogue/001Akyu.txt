 

Akyu: It's been great to meet you, but I must return to my work. 

There is much information I need to record from my <b>previous visitor</b>... 

I do hope the reference material I requested from the <b>shop</b> arrives soon... 

Oh, and please visit again! 

I have many questions for you and your mistress! 

Reisen: **Do I have something for her? 

?{elixir=1} Reisen: **I have an elixir, but... 

?{elixir=1} Reisen: **I can't shake this ominous feeling about giving her one...

Akyu: Hm? What's this? [elixir]

Reisen: It's medication from my master. 

It should help you with that forgetful spell you're feeling. 

Akyu: Is that really...!? Please let me have it! 

Reisen: **Whoa, she's fast!

Reisen: Is this the <b>reference material</b> you needed? [textbook]

Akyu: Oh my! To think the medicine peddler is also doing book deliveries now too. 

Yes, it is. Thank you very much. 

Reisen: Um, no problem... 

Akyu: Since you're already here, could I trouble you with one more delivery? 

Reisen: Ah... um... sure I guess. 

Akyu: This is an old encyclopedia that I had acquired. 

It contains descriptions of various <b>Youkai</b> and methods of dealing with them. 

I've finished <b>transcribing</b> what I need from it. 

A <b>school teacher</b> in the village was asking to borrow it. 

Can you bring this to them? 

Reisen: A <b>school teacher</b>? 

**... Did I meet such a person? 

**They must have been one of the cubes. 

Sure, I will try. 

Akyu: Thank you very much.
