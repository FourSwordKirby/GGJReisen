Akyu: I should go thank Kosuzu at the book shop too. 
I'm probably being overly sentimental,
but it truly was a blessing that I met her. 
The Hieda house has always had good relations with her family's book shop. 
But, it was truly a coincidence that in this generation...
That their daughter and I were of similar age. 
Kosuzu's a very good friend. 
Without her, I would've never had written my mystery novel series...

Reisen: [expression] sad
**... I'm somewhat jealous.
**Do I have a friend like that?
