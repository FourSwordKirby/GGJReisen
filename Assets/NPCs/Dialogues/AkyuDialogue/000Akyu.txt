// 000 â€“ Bad Apple 

Akyu: "Even in the midst of flowing time, I feel languid." 
"See? Round and round, I spin..." 
There was a song like that, wasn't there? 

[expression] sweat
Reisen: Hello...? 

Akyu: Ah, please excuse my ramblings. How can I help you? 

[expression] sad
Reisen: Erm... I thought I'd just say hello. 
**At least that's what Yukari said to do. 

Akyu: Good day to you too. 
But my, this is rather unexpected. 
For elusive Youkai rabbits to show one after another... 
Did your mistress at Eientei ask you to start making friends? 

[expression] sweat
Reisen: Um, no that's not quite it. 
[expression] normal
Or rather, who are you? 
How do you know about my master and me? 

Akyu: Oh pardon, I am the head of the esteemed <b>Hieda</b> household. 
I know all there needs to be known about <b>Gensokyo</b>. 
Of course, that includes you, Reisen. 
I also know how difficult it is to have a conversation with you. 

[expression] sad
Reisen: I think I speak more reasonably than many folks running around here... 

Akyu: That's not quite what I meant. 
I hear you come in and out of the village without staying long. 
Never saying a word more than necessary for your medicine business. 
And even if someone does find you, you vanish before their very eyes. 
Something like that? 

[expression] annoy
Reisen: Well, that's not entirely wrong. 
[expression] normal
I'd rather not intrude for too long. 
Though right now, I have business with the whole village. 
Actually, I'm surprised you're able to remember your <b>sense of self</b>. 
The entire village is under a spell of sorts right now... 

Akyu: ... 
Is that how I seem? 
I definitely feel as though I've forgotten something <b>important</b>. 
It might not be wrong to say I've been afflicted too. 

[expression] annoy
Reisen: **Well, you certainly are a cube. 
**But I don't think you've noticed that.
