Akyu: "Is it painful? Is it sad?" 

"Not even knowing myself." 

Yes, there indeed was a song like that... 

Oh, greetings Reisen. 

What brings the elusive Youkai rabbit to the Hieda estate? 

Reisen: **Do I have something for her? 

?{elixir=1} Reisen: **I have an elixir, but... 

?{elixir=1} Reisen: **I can't shake this ominous feeling about giving her one...

Akyu: Hm? What's this? [elixir]

Reisen: It's medication from my master. 

It should help you remember yourself. 

Akyu: From Miss Yagokoro!? Is that really... Please let me have it! 

Reisen: **Whoa, she's fast!

Akyu: This is a... mystery novel? [novel]

Reisen: By a Gensokyo native named Agatha Chris-Q. 

The rabbit I got it from said it was very good. 

It's part of a series, which is apparently still ongoing. 

Akyu: Aah... yes, how could I have forgotten... 

It was because <b>Kosuzu</b> was so insistent on selling mystery novels... 

Reisen: Hm? 

Akyu: I didn't mention this earlier, but as a Child of Miare... 

I only retain memories related to the <b>Gensokyo Chronicles</b> from my past lives. 

There are very few personal memories included... 

Something as goofy as this, I shouldn't remember but... 

Reisen: Um... I don't follow... 

Akyu: This novel just reminded me of a very precious memory. 

One that I had somehow forgotten. 

Agatha Chris-Q is <b>my</b> pen name. 

Yes, this mystery novel is written by <b>me</b>. 

Not as a member of the esteemed Hieda chroniclers... 

But as a silly girl who wanted to try something fun with her friend. 

Indeed, this is a part of <b>me</b> that no other Child of Miare can claim. 

Reisen: I feel like I'm missing something... 

But I guess this means you've remembered who you are? 

Akyu: Yes... I think so... 

Thank you for bringing this to me. 

If you want to read my series, you can get them at the book shop. 

The shop keeper, Kosuzu, is who inspired me into writing them. 

Reisen: **A personality shard manifested!
