<i>Though the blissful sounds of pointless arguments were back, Reisen still couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off. 

<i>Once Reisen had gathered the memory shards, Reimu told her to put them into the compartment of one of the strange Lunarian monoliths.</i>

<i>After directing her with some frustratingly unclear instructions, it emitted a bright light and returned the Human Village and its inhabitants to normal, while also spilling forth an excessive number of peaches.</i>
