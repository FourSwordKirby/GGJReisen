Toyohime: Oh my! I didn’t think that there were chefs on earth who could do our Lunarian peaches justice. 

Toyohime: And to think we even got the whole place to ourselves. 

Yorihime: Yes Eirin, the invitation was unexpected so we couldn’t refuse, but this is far more delightful than I could have managed. 

Eirin: No need to thank me. After Reisen told me of what happened, it simply made more sense to do things in a more straightforward manner. 

Eirin: Though her choice in venue was pretty decent.

Tewi: Waiterrrrr, one more slice of peach cake please~

<color=#3399ff>Reisen</color>: I-I'll take a peach ice cream bowl for my dessert. 

<i>It's finally over. 

<i>The strange storage devices strewn throughout town turned out be just that, storage boxes for peaches that the Watatsuki sisters tried to send to Eientei. </i>

<i>Rather than any hostile act to spread their influence over Gensokyo, they were simply apologies for all the trouble caused by the Lunar Invasion incident. </i>

<i>As it turns out, they were attacked and malfunctioned while in transit, landing in the Human Village and causing the latest set of havok. </i>

<i>As for who they were attacked by? Reisen asked Reimu if she knew anything. </i>

<i>Though Reimu adamantly asserted she had no idea. </i>

<i>For her, lying came as easy as breathing... </i>

<i>Taking a bite of the freshly candied peaches, Reisen’s mind drifted.</i>
