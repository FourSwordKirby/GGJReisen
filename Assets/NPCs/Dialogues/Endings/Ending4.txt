Toyohime: Oh my! I didn’t think that there were chefs on earth who could do our Lunarian peaches justice. 

Toyohime: And to think we even got the whole place to ourselves. 

Yorihime: Yes Eirin, the invitation was unexpected so we couldn’t refuse, but this is far more delightful than I could have managed. 

Eirin: No need to thank me. After Reisen told me of what happened, it simply made more sense to do things in a more straightforward manner. 

Eirin: Though her choice in venue was pretty decent.

<i>It's finally over.

<i>As it turns out, they were attacked and malfucntioned while in transit, landing in the Human Village and causing the latest set of havok. </i>

<i>As for who they were attacked by? Reisen asked Reimu if she knew anything. </i>

<i>Though she adamantly asserted she had no idea. </i>

<i>For Reimu, lying came as easy as breathing... </i>

<i>Taking a bite of the freshly candied peaches, Reisen’s mind drifted.</i>
