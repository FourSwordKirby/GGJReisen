// 300 â€“ Knowing too much history 

Reisen: You... seem to be thinking deeply about something. 
**Did I guess right?
Keine: Yeah, something has been bothering me for a while. 
I know that, as my job, I'm supposed to know a lot of history... 
But some of these events... feel incredibly real to me? 
It's almost like I was there. 
But that can't be, these events I'm thinking about are from a several generations ago. 
There's no way I was alive during that time, right? 
Reisen: How should I know? 
**This person seems to on the verge of remembering themselves.
**Do I have anything that can give them the final push?

Keine: This is... wow, this is really old. [encyclopedia]
This is part of the set that the old emperor Huang Di had transcribed. 
I am surprised that it is still around... 
Though I suppose if it is in Gensokyo, it has been lost to the outside world, and has passed into fantasy. 
Yes... since you are a youkai, I suppose it is safe to tell you. 
This encyclopedia volume. Its information was given to Emperor Huang Di by my ancestors, the Hakutaku. 
Distant ancestors... I am barely a part of them. 
I am the were-Hakutaku, <b>Keine Kamishirasawa</b>.
