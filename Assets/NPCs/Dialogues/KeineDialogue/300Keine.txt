// 300 â€“ Knowing too much history 

Reisen: Hello?

Keine: Oh, hi again.

Reisen: [expression] sad
Is something on your mind?

Keine: Yeah, something's been bothering me for a while. 
As a <b>history teacher</b>, I know a lot of history... 
But some of these events feel incredibly real to me.
It's almost like I was there. 
But that can't be...
These stories are from several generations ago...
There's no way I was alive during that time, right?

Reisen: [expression] sweat
I mean, maybe if you were a <b>youkai</b>...

Keine: What is this? [elixir]
Reisen: A potion to cure the virus affecting you.
Keine: Virus?
Reisen: [expression] ugh

[expression] sad
It'll help you see what I see. 
[expression] normal
There's an invisible virus plaguing the human village...
This'll help you see it. 
Keine: An invisible plague...?
... For the sake of the humans, I'll trust you on this.

Keine: This encyclopedia is... [encyclopedia]

Reisen: The Hieda head asked me to give this to you.

Keine: Wow, I can't believe she really had this.
This is part of a set that emperor Huang Di had transcribed. 
I'm surprised it's still around.
Now that I think about it...
The information in this book originally came from the <b>Hakutaku</b>.
And...

Reisen: [expression] sad
And?

Keine: And the <b>Hakutaku</b>... are my distant ancestors.
I remember now.
I am the were-Hakutaku, <b>Keine Kamishirasawa</b>.
