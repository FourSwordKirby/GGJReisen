Keine: Oh, welcome to the human village.
You're not a human, are you? 

Reisen: [expression] shock
Oh shoot, I forgot my disguise!

Keine: Well, it's okay.
There are already a bunch of other <b>youkai</b> coming in and out. 
Please don't cause trouble for anyone here. 

Reisen: [expression] sweat
To be so calm in front of a <b>youkai</b>...
[expression] ugh
**And even to lecture me...  
[expression] sad
**Aren't humans taught to fear <b>youkai</b>?
[expression] normal
Who are you?

Keine: I'm... Hm...?
I'm a <i>person</i>. 

Reisen: [expression] sweat
No, I meant your name.

Keine: For some reason, <b>I don't remember</b>.

Reisen: [expression] shock
Isn't that really bad!?

Keine: I suppose...
But I don't think my name's very important.

Reisen: [expression] sweat
No. No. No. Knowing your own name is very important.
[expression] sad
**Is this a symptom of the <b>virus</b>
**I need to <b>help people remember themselves</b>, right?
[expression] normal
What DO you remember about yourself?

Keine: Pretty sure I'm a human.

Reisen: [expression] sweat
That's a... rather odd thing to say.
Saying something like that makes it more likely you aren't...

Keine: ... That's weird. There's no way I'm not a human.
You're right. I don't know why I had such a thought. 

Reisen: [expression] sad
Suspicious...
