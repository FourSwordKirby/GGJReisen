Keine: Would you look at that.
It turns out I'm not human, but half-youkai...

Reisen: [expression] annoy
No wonder you were so suspicious at the start. 
[expression] sweat
Why's a youkai teaching history to humans? 

Keine: Well, the Hakutaku have always been friends to the humans. 
My Were-Hakutaku abilities allow me to know all of Gensokyo's history. 
I merely wished to protect the human village with my knowledge. 
By passing history down through the generations...
I ensure that humans can protect themselves from both youkai and themselves.
Indeed, from that perspective...
I've protected the village for far longer than the shrine maiden. 

Reisen: [expression] sad
Are the humans okay with a youkai teacher though?

Keine: It's unfortunate, but I do hide that fact from them.

Reisen: [expression] normal
Didn't you say you've been around for a long time?
Haven't the humans become suspicious of you? 

Keine: No. With each generation that passed...
I used my ability to conceal my own history. 
The length of my life is unknowable to the humans.
It's a double-edged sword in its own way. 
I have to reintroduce myself every so often. 

Reisen: [expression] sad
That seems like more trouble than its worth. 

Keine: Is that so? 

Reisen: [expression] normal
I'd rather not talk to people that I don't expect a lasting relationship with... 

Keine: Well, maybe you don't know this because you're a youkai. 
But for humans, life is short.
Every moment counts, no matter how long or short. 
When I look at history, it's all just a collection of moments.
Nothing lasts forever. 
A rich history is one with many moments, many relationships. 
So, thinking like "it needs to be a lasting relationship" is flawed. 

Reisen: [expression] sweat
That sounds like a very human reasoning. 

Keine: Sure, I might've been influenced by living with them for so long.
So I've figured, why not try doing as they do too? 

Reisen: [expression] sad
**When in Gensokyo, do as the Gensokyian's do...?
[expression] shock
**Oh, a really big Personality Shard manifested!
