 

Keine: Indeed. It turns out I am not human, I am a youkai myself... 

Reisen: Huh, no wonder you were so suspicious at the start. 

What's a youkai like you teaching history to humans? 

Keine: Well, you see, the Hakutaku have always been friends to the humans. 

As a were-Hakutaku, I am able to manipulate and know all of Gensokyo's history. 

With such power, it inevitably followed that I wished to protect the human village with my knowledge. 

By passing down the stories about other youkai, 

I can ensure that each generation is armed with the knowledge to fear youkai and how to protect themselves. 

Indeed, I'm willing to say I've been protecting the village for far longer than the current shrine maiden. 

Reisen: Hm? If you've been around that long, haven't the humans become suspicious of you? 

Keine: With each generation that passed, I used my ability to conceal my own history. 

The length of my life in this village is unknowable to the humans around. 

It's a double-edged sword in its own way. 

I have to reintroduce myself every so often. 

Reisen: That seems like more trouble than its worth. 

Keine: Is that so? 

Reisen: I can't be bothered to talk to people that I don't expect to make a lasting relationship with... 

Keine: Well, maybe you don't know this because you're a youkai. 

But for humans, life is short. Every moment counts, no matter how long or short. 

When I look at history, it's all just a collection of moments. Nothing lasts forever. 

A rich history is one with many moments, many relationships. 

So, thinking like "it needs to be a lasting relationship" is flawed. 

Reisen: That sounds like a very human reasoning. 

Keine: Sure, I might've been influenced by living with them for so long. 

So I've figured, why not try doing as they do too? 

Reisen: **When in Gensokyo, do as the Gensokyian's do...?
