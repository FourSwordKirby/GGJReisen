Keine: There’s some sort of <b>contraption</b> over there that I’ve never seen before. 

I wonder what it is? 

I saw someone fiddling with it earlier this morning. 

Reisen: **I should check out that <b>contraption</b>. It might be related to the incident.

**Also, it looks like this person <b>has more to say.</b>
