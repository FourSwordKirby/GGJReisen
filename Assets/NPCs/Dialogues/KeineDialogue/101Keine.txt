Keine: Is this your first time here? Do you need a tour?

Reisen: [expression] sad
No, I've...
[expression] sweat
...
**I've been here plenty of times...
**But now that everything is a cube...
**I can't tell what's what anymore.

Keine: If you need directions, I can help.
Like for example, that right there is a <i>building</i>.

Reisen: [expression] ugh
O-oh...
[expression] sweat
**I guess it is kind of shaped like one.
[expression] normal
What kind of building?

Keine: A <i>building</i> of course.

Reisen: [expresion] sweat
No, no, no... Is it a store? A restaurant? An inn?

Keine: Huh? I told you, it's a <i>building</i>.

Reisen: [expression] angry
Are you pulling my leg here!? 

Keine: No? I'm trying to be helpful here. 
Don't you see from the sign in the front?
It clearly says that it's a <i>building</i>.

Reisen: [expression] ugh
There's a sign? What...?
It's all cubes... It doesn't say anything!

Keine: Is your vision okay?
Wait, are you feeling okay?
Do you have a fever? 

Reisen: [expression] shock
Am I the lunatic here!? 
**Does she not see what's going on?
**And why can't she call it anything other than a <i>building</i>?
[expression] ugh
**...
**Maybe this is an effect of the virus?
[expression] sad
**Yukari mentioned the boundary of <b>simplicity and complexity</b>.
**Is <i>vocabulary</i> also getting <b>simplified</b>...?
