It's not a holiday today.

**In order to manifest a <b>Personality Shard</b>...
**I need to direct the conversation to reveal their personality.

Reisen: [expression] annoy [why]
What's the point of learning history?
There's so much baggage in the past.

Sheesh, kids are too imprudent these days. 
Listen, history is all about warnings and cautions.
Without it, you might endanger yourself and those around with your ignorance.
"Those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it."

Reisen: [expression] annoy
Ahh... Is that so... 
[expression] ugh
**To think I'd get lectured here...
[expression] normal
**Hm?
[expression] shock
**Another <b>Personality shard</b>!

Sure, I can listen for a bit.

And then shortly after, another <i>event</i>...

Uh, that's not very specific...

There were actually several <i>events</i> during the first one.
In chronological order, first that <i>event</i> happened...

Reisen: [expression] ugh
**This isn't working...
**The virus has <b>simplified</b> her entire lesson...
**I can't tell what she's talking about...

Keine: Are you paying attention?
*sigh* Well, do as you will...

Reisen: [expression] sad
**Did I mess up?
