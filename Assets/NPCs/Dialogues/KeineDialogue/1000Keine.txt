Keine: Whoa! 
Reisen: Oh! You're the half-youkai school teacher! 
Keine: Yes. My name is Keine. How did I forget that earlier...? 
But forget that, what's with all of these blocks!?  
Reisen: It's an attack by the Lunarians. Everyone's been reduced to this... 
Keine: Oh no... what happened to the humans...? 
Reisen: They're still here. They're the blocks around us. 
I'm working to unravel this incident right now. 
Keine: A youkai, protecting the humans? I find that hard to believe. 
Reisen: As an ex-Lunarian, I have an obligation to clean up after my former nation's mess... 
Keine: Haaah... I'll buy that for now. 
But if you make one wrong move, I'll eat your entire history to make you disappear. 
Reisen: I'm just trying to help!
