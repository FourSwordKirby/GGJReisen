Keine: Whoa! 

Reisen: [expression] shock
Oh! You're the half-youkai school teacher! 

Keine: Yes. <b>Keine Kamishirasawa</b>.
How did I forget that earlier...? 
But forget that, what's with all of these cubes!?  

Reisen: [expression] sad
It's an attack by the Lunarians.
Everyone's been reduced to this... 

Keine: Oh no...
What happened to the humans...?

Reisen: [expression] normal
They're still here.
They're the blocks around us. 
I'm working to unravel this incident right now. 

Keine: A youkai, protecting the humans?
I find that hard to believe. 

Reisen: [expression] sad
As an ex-Lunarian, I'm obligated to help in this mess...

Keine: Haaah... I'll buy that for now.
But one wrong move, and eradicate you from history!

Reisen: [expression] shock
I'm just trying to help!
