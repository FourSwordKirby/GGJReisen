LunarReisen: Wah! Wait! Pause! 

Reisen: [expression] angry
You aren't getting away! 

LunarReisen: Wait please! I just got a text message from my masters! 
"We've been held up. Did you complete your <b>task</b>?"
What awfully shady phrasing!
What <b>task</b> is this talking about!?

Reisen: [expression] ugh
You're clearly guilty! 

LunarReisen: No! Please! 

Reisen: [expression] angry
Prepare yourself! 

LunarReisen: Wah! 
Oh wait, a second text. 
"Feel free to take a peach for yourself as a reward <3" 
... What is this talking about? 
... 
Aha... I give up... 

Reisen: [expression] sweat
...
Are you... are you crying? 

LunarReisen: I don't know what's going on. 
I got sent to Earth to do something I can't remember. 
Not only did I fail to carry out my masters' orders...
But I'm also now being convicted of biochemical terrorism. 
I have no idea why any of this happened. 
I just wanted to get away from a life of pounding mochi.
How did my life turn out like this... ?

Reisen: [expression] sad
...
[expression] sweat
I might've, uh, gotten carried away. 
[expression] ugh
My bad... 

LunarReisen: Uuu...
