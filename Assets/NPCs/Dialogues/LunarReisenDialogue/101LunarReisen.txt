LunarReisen: Wah! Wait! Pause! 

Reisen: You aren't getting away! 

LunarReisen: Wait please! I just got a text message from my masters! 

... "We've been held up. Did you complete your <b>task</b>?"... 

What awfully shady phrasing! 

What task is this talking about!? 

Reisen: You're clearly guilty! 

LunarReisen: No! Please! 

Reisen: Prepare yourself! 

LunarReisen: Wah! 

Oh wait, a second text. 

"Feel free to take a peach for yourself as a reward <3" 

... What is this talking about? 

... 

Aha... I give up... 

Reisen: ... Are you... are you crying? 

LunarReisen: I don't know what's going on. 

I got sent down here to Earth to do some task that I can't remember. 

Not only did I fail to carry out my master's orders, 

But I'm also now being convicted of biochemical terrorism. 

And to top it off, I have no idea why any of this happened. 

I just wanted to get away from a life of pounding mochi. 

How did my life turn out like this... 

Reisen: ... 

I might've, uh, gotten carried away. 

My bad... 

LunarReisen: Uuu...
