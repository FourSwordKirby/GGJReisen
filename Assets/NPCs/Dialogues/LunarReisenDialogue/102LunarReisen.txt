LunarReisen: I'm not doing anything suspicious. I swear... 

If I just sit here and read, will you leave me alone? 

Reisen: **She's reading a mystery novel. 

Reisen: **Do I have something for her?

Reisen: Here, take this. [elixir]

LunarReisen: What is this? Medicine? 

Reisen: It should help you remember anything you've forgotten. 

LunarReisen: ... 

I don't want it... 

I'd rather just wait here until my masters come get me... 

Reisen: Is that so...? 

LunarReisen: ... well, also, this mystery novel is actually really interesting. 

Why don't they just use DNA tracing to find the culprit? 

Earth technology is so weird... 

**She just wants to read!? (end)


Reisen: I've been investigating throughout the village [schematic]

And I've got reason to believe you might not be the culprit anymore. 

LunarReisen: Oh, is that so... 

Reisen: Erm... 

I found an old diagram of the <b>Dimensionality Reducers</b>. 

From what I learned, those devices have a <b>simplification algorithm</b>. 

A Kappa seems to have broken one of devices. 

I suspect that might've caused the algorithm to get unleashed on the village. 

She didn't seem aware of that fact though. 

LunarReisen: Aaaah... 

Reisen: There is good news though. 

The <b>Dimensionality Reducers</b> should have a feature to undo the simplification. 

I don't know how to invoke it though. 

LunarReisen: Ah! 

Right, it's all coming back to me now. 

The honorable <b>Watatsuki Sisters</b> sent me here! 

I need to stop the simplification leakage in the case it happened! 

I don't have time to be reading! 

Reisen: **Oh, she dropped the book. 

**What is this? 

** "A mystery novel by the acclaimed Agatha Chris-Q"?
