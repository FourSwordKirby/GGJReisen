LunarReisen: I'm not doing anything suspicious. I swear... 
If I just sit here and read, will you leave me alone? 

Reisen: **She's reading a mystery novel. 
Reisen: **Do I have something for her?

Reisen: Here, take this. [elixir]

LunarReisen: What is this? Medicine? 

Reisen: It should help you remember anything you've forgotten. 

LunarReisen: ... 
I don't want it... 
I'd rather wait here until my masters come get me... 

Reisen: [expression] sweat
Is that so...? 

LunarReisen: ... well, also, this mystery novel is really interesting!
Why don't they just use DNA tracing to find the culprit? 
Earth technology is so primitive... 

Reisen: [expression] shock
**She just wants to read!?

(end)


Reisen: I've been investigating throughout the village. [schematic]
And I've got reason to believe you aren't the culprit anymore. 

LunarReisen: Oh, is that so... 

Reisen: [expression] sad
Erm... 
[expression] normal
I found an old diagram of the <b>Dimensionality Reducers</b>. 
From what I learned, those devices have a <b>simplification algorithm</b>. 
[expression] sad
A Kappa seems to have messed with one of the devices. 
I suspect that might've caused the algorithm to get unleashed on the village. 
[expression] ugh
The Kappa didn't seem aware of that fact though. 

LunarReisen: Aaaah... 

Reisen: [expression] normal
There is good news though.
The <b>Dimensionality Reducers</b> should have a feature to undo the simplification.
I don't know how to invoke it though.

LunarReisen: Ah! 
Right, it's all coming back to me now!
The honorable <b>Watatsuki Sisters</b> sent me here! 
I need to stop the <b>simplification leakage</b> in the case it happened! 
I don't have time to be reading! 

Reisen: [expression] sweat
**Oh, she dropped the book. 
**What is this? 
[expression] sad
**"A mystery novel by the acclaimed Agatha Chris-Q"?
