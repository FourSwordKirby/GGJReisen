Reisen: [expression] shock
Ah!

LunarReisen: Ah!

Reisen: [expression] shock
It's you! 

LunarReisen: Right, I remember now! 
You're <b>Reisen</b>!  
You're my masters' previous pet!
The one that ran away to Earth! 

Reisen: Y-yeah.
[expression] normal
And you're also <b>Reisen</b>, right? 
[expression] sad
You're my replacement at the Lunar Capital now... 

LunarReisen: ... 

Reisen: [expression] heh
... Life's rough up there, isn't it? 

LunarReisen: ...Yes. As usual... 

Reisen: [expression] normal
So what was that about the <b>Watatsuki Sisters</b>? 
[expression] annoy
Are the lunar princesses interfering with Earth again?

LunarReisen: Right! The <b>Dimensionality Reducers</b>! 
We were transporting them from the moon to Earth with a quantum tunnel. 
But an outside interference knocked them off trajectory...
And they crash landed in the village. 
I'm here to make sure they weren't broken- 
Though I guess it's too late now. 

Reisen: [expression] sad
So I was on the money, wasn't I? 
[expression] normal
This cube phenomenon isn't really a virus...
But an effect of the reducer's <b>simplification algorithm</b> leaking out. 

LunarReisen: Yes... But it's okay now.
Lady Toyohime taught me how to invoke the <b>reversal algorithm</b>. 
I had somehow forgotten when I arrived... 

Reisen: [expression] ugh
Well, get moving.
[expression] sad
I'd like to get this phenomenon fixed finally. 

LunarReisen: R-right! 
Um...
There's a small problem...

Reisen: [expression] annoy
Oh no... what now? 

LunarReisen: The <b>simplification algorithm</b> works by removing information to compress data. 
The excess information is usually stored as a <b>small key</b>. 
We need that key to reconstruct everything that was simplified. 
Otherwise, the reversal process will only be 90% correct. 

Reisen: [expression] sweat
Okay... so where do we get the <b>key</b>? 

LunarReisen: Well, I don't know. 
One is made each time you put something into the container. 
But since the simplification leaked out of the container...
I don't know where that key could be... 

Reisen: [expression] normal
What's it look like?

LunarReisen: Tiny rock shards, I guess? 

Reisen: [expression] sad
**... Could that be the <b>Personality Shards</b>? 
[expression] normal
Like these things? 

LunarReisen: Yes those!
Great, this will work perfectly then!
When you're ready, bring me all of the shards you've collected!
Make sure you've got all of them! 
Otherwise we might end up with 90% of a human in a village!
