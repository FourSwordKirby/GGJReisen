Reisen: Ah! 

LunarReisen: Ah! 

Reisen: It's you! 

LunarReisen: Right, I remember now! 

You're <b>Reisen</b>!  

You're my masters' previous pet that ran away to Earth! 

Reisen: Y-yeah. And you're also <b>Reisen</b>, right? 

You're my replacement at the Lunar Capital now... 

LunarReisen: ... 

Reisen: ... Life's rough up there, isn't it? 

LunarReisen: ...Yes. As usual... 

Reisen: So what was that about the Watatsuki Sisters? 

What are the lunar princesses doing, interfering with Earth again? 

LunarReisen: Right! The <b>Dimensionality Reducers</b>! 

We were transporting those from the moon to the earth via a quantum tunnel. 

But some outside interference knocked them off trajectory, 

and they crash landed in the village. 

I was sent to make sure they hadn't broken- 

Though I guess it's too late now. 

Reisen: So I was on the money, wasn't I? 

This cube phenomenon isn't really a virus, 

But an effect of the reducer's <b>simplification algorithm</b> leaking out. 

LunarReisen: Yes. But it's okay. 

Lady Toyohime taught me how to invoke the reversal algorithm. 

I had somehow forgotten when I arrived... 

Reisen: Well, get moving. I'd like to get this phenomenon fixed finally. 

LunarReisen: R-right! 

Um... there's a small problem. 

Reisen: Oh no... what now? 

LunarReisen: The <b>simplification algorithm</b> works by removing information to compress data. 

The excess information is usually stored as a small key. 

We need that key to fully reconstruct everything that was simplified. 

Otherwise, the reversal process will only be 90% correct. 

Reisen: Okay... so where do we get the key? 

LunarReisen: Well, I don't know. 

One is made each time you put something into the container. 

But since the simplification leaked out of the container, 

I don't know where that key could be... 

Reisen: What's it look like? 

LunarReisen: Tiny rock shards, I guess? 

Reisen: **... Could that be the <b>Personality Shards</b>? 

Like these things? 

LunarReisen: Yes those! 

Great, this will work out perfectly then! 

Please bring me all of the shards you've collected when you're ready! 

Make sure you've got all of them! 

Otherwise we might end up with 90% of a human in a village!
