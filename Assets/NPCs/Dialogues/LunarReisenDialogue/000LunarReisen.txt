LunarReisen: Haaah...
I was just asked a ton of questions by an <b>earthling</b>...
I wonder if it was okay to answer her like that.
... She gave me a lot of cool books in return though!

Reisen: [expression] shock
**A speaking box!?
[expression] sweat
**Oh wait, it's another person.
[expression] sad
**She said <b>earthling</b> as though she isn't one...
[expression] sweat
**Don't tell me this person is from <b>outer space</b>?
**I should be wary.
