Reisen: Hey, you mentioned you’re a lunarian... 

Are you the one that caused this incident? 

LunarReisen: What's an incident? 

Reisen: Erm, the <b>simplification virus</b>. 

And also the <b>Dimensionality Reducers</b> around town. 

Were those your doing? 

LunarReisen: <b>Dimensionality Reducers</b>? The storage devices? 

Um... maybe? I think I was supposed do to something with them. 

Maybe that was the <b>important thing</b> I forgot? 

I don't know anything about a virus. 

Reisen: Now that I think about it, the answer seems too obvious, doesn't it? 

A Lunarian suddenly arrives in the village. 

A bunch of lunar storage containers appear in tow in scattered locations. 

And a virus has infected everyone now. 

Simply put... 

You brought a bunch of canisters of a virus to infect the village! 

This is outright biochemical terrorism! 

LunarReisen: Wait what!? That's crazy! 

I don't know anything about this! I swear! 

Reisen: Great! I figured out the mystery! 

Time to beat you up until you cough up the antidote!
