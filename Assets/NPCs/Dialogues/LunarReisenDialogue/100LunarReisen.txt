Reisen: Hey, you mentioned you're a <b>Lunarian</b>... 
Are you the one that caused this incident? 

LunarReisen: What's an incident? 

Reisen: [expression] sad
The <b>simplification virus</b>.
And also the <b>Dimensionality Reducers</b> around town.
[expression] sweat
Were those your doing? 

LunarReisen: <b>Dimensionality Reducers</b>? The storage devices? 
Um... maybe?
I think I was supposed do to something with them. 
Maybe that was the <b>important thing</b> I forgot? 
I don't know anything about a virus. 

Reisen: [expression] ugh
Now that I think about it, the answer seems too obvious, doesn't it? 
[expression] heh
A Lunarian suddenly arrives in the village. 
A bunch of lunar storage containers appear in tow in scattered locations. 
And a virus has infected everyone now. 
Simply put... 
[expression] angry
You brought a bunch of canisters of a virus to infect the village! 
This is outright biochemical terrorism! 

LunarReisen: Wait what!? That's crazy! 
I don't know anything about this! I swear! 

Reisen: [expression] happy
Great! I figured out the mystery! 
[expression] angry
Time to beat you up until you cough up the antidote!  

[instruction] Stage100
