Reisen: [expression] shock
Ah! 

LunarReisen: Ah! 

Reisen: [expression] sweat
It's you! 

LunarReisen: Right, I remember you now!

Reisen: [expression] normal
You're <b>Reisen</b>, right? 
The Honorable Watatsuki Sisters' new pet... 

LunarReisen: Yes, and you are... also <b>Reisen</b>. 
The Honorable Watatsuki Sister's previous pet that ran away. 

Reisen: [expression] annoy
... 

LunarReisen: ... 

Reisen: [expression] normal
What's a Moon Rabbit doing here? 
I haven't seen you since you or the Lunar Princesses since Eientei.

LunarReisen: Um... Frankly I don't remember... 
I was here to do something <b>important</b>. 
I think I lost something <b>important</b> too... 

Reisen: [expression] sweat
Are you the Lunarian that's causing trouble here? 
The one that set the virus upon town? 

LunarReisen: A virus...? 
No, I don't think I was sent to do anything like that... 

Reisen: [expression] annoy
Oh?

LunarReisen: No, really!
I wasn't told anything like that! Really! 
You know how the Lunarians are!
They don't tell us Moon Rabbits anything important... 

Reisen: [expression] ugh
Well, I kind of understand. 

LunarReisen: Waaah, what is going on!? 
Why did I get sent down to earth? I can't remember! 
Can I just run for now?
You know what, I don't care anymore! 
I'm going to go hide at the shrine!
If anyone asks, the shrine maiden kidnapped me! 
Don't tell anyone, please!

Reisen: [expression] annoy
Ah, yeah, I guess. 
[expression] sweat
I guess that's a good plan... 
**Sorry Reimu.
