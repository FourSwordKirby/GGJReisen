Reisen: Ah! 

LunarReisen: Ah! 

Reisen: It's you! 

LunarReisen: Right, I remember now! Huh? It's you! 

Reisen: <b>Reisen</b>, right? 

The Honorable Watatsuki Sisters' new pet... 

LunarReisen: Yes, and you are... also <b>Reisen</b>. 

The Honorable Watatsuki Sister's previous pet that ran away. 

Reisen: ... 

LunarReisen: ... 

Reisen: What's a moon rabbit doing here? 

I haven't seen you since that sudden visit at Eientei. 

LunarReisen: Um... Frankly I don't remember... 

I was here to do something <b>important</b>. 

I think I lost something <b>important</b> too... 

Reisen: Are you the Lunarian that's causing trouble here? 

The one that set the virus upon town? 

LunarReisen: A virus...? 

No, I don't think I was sent to do anything like that... 

Reisen: Oh? 

LunarReisen: No, really! I wasn't told anything like that! Really! 

You know how the Lunarians are! 

They don't tell us moon rabbits anything important... 

Reisen: Well, I kind of understand. 

LunarReisen: Waaah, what is going on!? 

Why did I get sent down to earth? I can't remember! 

Can I just run for now? 

You know what, I don't care anymore! 

I'm going to go hide at the shrine and say the shrine maiden abducted me! 

Don't tell anyone, please! 

Reisen: Ah, yeah, I guess. 

I guess that's a good plan... 

**Sorry Reimu.
