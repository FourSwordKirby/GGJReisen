LunarReisen: Wahhh, I can't remember what I lost!
And I don't even know the way back to the <b>school</b>!
... Maybe I should run away.
Maybe that girl who interviewed me can take me in...
I could just read mystery novels all day...

Reisen: **Do I have something for this person?
**They're probably an <b>extraterrestrial</b>...

Reisen: Here, take this. [elixir]

LunarReisen: What is that?

Reisen: It's medicine to help with remembering things.

LunarReisen: Eh? Oh? Uh... su-sure?
This is kind of suspicious...
But for some reason, I feel like I can trust you.

Reisen: Would this happen to be yours? [smartphone]

LunarReisen: Ah, no way, you found my <b>smartphone</b>!
My <b>masters</b> entrusted me with it.
Ahhh! I'm so glad you found it!
They would have been furious with me!

Reisen: [expression] sweat
Hold on, that's a Lunarian smartphone.
Are you... a <b>Lunarian</b>?
[expression] sad
Or maybe, your masters are...?

LunarReisen: Huh? Yes, I guess I am a <b>Lunarian</b>.
Are you also interested in hearing about the moon?
Earthlings are quite curious, aren't they?
Never in my life would I have imagined so.
The <b>Lunar Capital</b> calls Earth a <i>wasteland of impurity</i>.
But, the people here aren't the monsters I had imagined.

Reisen: [expression] annoy
**That's ridiculous.
[expression] sad
**Though, I had the same thoughts when I first arrived on Earth...

LunarReisen: I found this <b>rare magazine</b> while I was looking around.
Consider it thanks for finding my phone!

Reisen: Is this wrench yours? [wrench]

LunarReisen: Umm, yes!
...I think?
I don't think that's the lost item I was thinking of.
But I do need it fix something...
I think...
Thanks for bringing it!

Reisen: [expression] sweat
**Was that right...?
