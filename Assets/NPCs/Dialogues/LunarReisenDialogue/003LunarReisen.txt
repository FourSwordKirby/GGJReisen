LunarReisen: Wahhh, I can't remember what I lost!
... Maybe I should just run away.
Maybe I can get that girl who interviewed me to take me in.
I could just read mystery novels all day...
Reisen: **Do I have something for this person?

Reisen: Here, take this. [elixir]
LunarReisen: Huh? What is that?
Reisen: It's medicine that can help you remember what you're looking for.
LunarReisen: Eh? Oh? Uh... su-sure?
... This is kind of suspicious, but for some reason I feel like I can trust you.

Reisen: Would this happen to be yours? [smartphone]
LunarReisen: Ah, no way, you found it!
This smartphone was entrusted to me by my master...
Ahhh! I'm so glad you found it!
They would have been furious with me!
Reisen: Hold on, that's a Lunarian smartphone.
Are you... a Lunarian? Or maybe, your masters are...?
LunarReisen: Huh? Yes, I guess you Gensokyo folks would call me a Lunarian.
Are you also interested in hearing about the moon?
Earthlings are quite curious, aren't they?
Never in my life would I have imagined so.
The Lunar Capital calls Earth a wasteland of impurity.
The people here aren't the monsters I thought they'd be.
Here, I found this rare magazine while I was looking around.
Consider it thanks for finding my phone!

Reisen: Is this wrench yours?
LunarReisen: Oh!
... Yes, I think?
I don't think that's the lost item I was thinking of.
But I do need it fix something...
I think.
Thanks for bringing it!
Reisen: **Was that right...?
