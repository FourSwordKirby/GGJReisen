LunarReisen: Oh no!
Reisen: Yes!?
LunarReisen: I dropped something <b>important</b>!
... But what was it? I don't remember.
Reisen: Don't ask me!
LunarReisen: Ah it's the girl I know but don't know.
Do you know what I dropped?
Reisen: How would I know!?
LunarReisen: Oh no... it was really important...
<b>Someone</b> is going to yell at me for losing it...
Reisen: **Ah, how pitiful...
**I know how you feel.... I guess.
