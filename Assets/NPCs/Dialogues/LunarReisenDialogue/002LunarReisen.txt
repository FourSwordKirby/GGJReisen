LunarReisen: Oh no!

Reisen: [expression] shock
Yes!?

LunarReisen: I dropped something important!
... But what was it?
I don't remember.

Reisen: [expression] annoy
Don't ask me!

LunarReisen: Ah it's the girl I know, but don't know.
Do you know what I dropped?

Reisen: [expression] angry
How would I know!?

LunarReisen: What could it be...? And where could it be...?
Before I got interviewed, I was at <b>school</b>...

Reisen: [expression] sweat
**School?
**Oh yeah, there was a school somewhere in the <b>west</b>...
[expression] ugh
**One of the many cubes now, I guess...

LunarReisen: Oh no... it was really important.
My <b>masters</b> are going to yell at me for losing it...

Reisen: [expression] sad
**How pitiful...
**I know how you feel... I guess.
