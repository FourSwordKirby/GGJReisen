LunarReisen: Oh no!

Reisen: [expression] shock
Yes!?

LunarReisen: I dropped something important!
... But what was it?
I don't remember.

Reisen: [expression] annoy
Don't ask me!

LunarReisen: Ah it's the girl I know, but don't know.
Do you know what I dropped?

Reisen: [expression] angry
How would I know!?

LunarReisen: Oh no... it was really important.
My <b>master</b> is going to yell at me for losing it...

Reisen: [expression] sad
**Ah, how pitiful...
**I know how you feel... I guess.
