Miyoi: Ah... there's so much work to do when the owner isn't around.

[expression] heh

With all of the stores lookin' the same you can't even tell that this is Geidontei! 

Reisen: Yeah I imagine it'd be hard. 

At least your sign seems to have been fixed. 

Miyoi: [expression] happy 

Miyoi: Yeah! I'm so glad it was restored too! 

Reisen: You mean you weren't the one that fixed it? 

Miyoi: Nope, it must be because of the hard work you've done in resolving the incident. 

I look forward to the grand feast you'll have here after you finish workin'!

Reisen: Yeah.

Speaking of which are you really the poster girl of <b>Geidontei</b>?

The signage all over the pub uses a normal whale.

Miyoi: Weeeeell. Even if I'm not on the poster, that doesn't mean I'm not the poster girl.

The word Geidon refers to when a powerful creature swallows a smaller one in one gulp.

So a whale definitely matches that description!

Reisen: Doesn't <b>Geidon</b> commonly refer to large countries swallowing up smaller ones.

[expression] ugh

Though I guess that's rather appropriate for the current incident.

Miyoi: If you think about it that way, it feels a little imposing. 

But that makes my job that much more important.

An imposing figure only needs a friendly face to be welcoming.

[expression] happy

And you'll find no friendlier face in the village than me!
