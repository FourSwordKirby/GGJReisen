Miyoi: Ah... there's so much work to do when the owner isn't around 

With all of the stores lookin' the same you can't even tell that this is Geidontei! 

Reisen: Yeah I imagine it'd be hard. 

At least your sign seems to have been fixed. 

[expression] smile 

Miyoi: Yeah! I'm so glad it was restored too! 

Reisen: You mean you weren't the one that fixed it? 

Miyoi: Nope, it must be because of the hard work you've done in resolving the incident. 

I look forward to the grand feast you'll have here after you finish workin' 

Reisen: Yeah 

Speaking of which, isn't this an odd way to write <b>Geidon</b>? 

Why specifically use the female kanji for whale over the male one 

Miyoi: I guess the owner wanted to make pub to sound more approachable? 

The word Geidon is refers to when a powerful creature swallows a smaller one in one gulp 

Though it makes sense as a customer enjoying a hearty drink 

Its common uses refers to the invasions of smaller lands by larger ones. 

If you think about it that way, it feels a little imposing. 

Though you'll find no friendlier face in the village than me!
