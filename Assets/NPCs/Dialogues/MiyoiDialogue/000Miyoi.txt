Miyoi: Oh Reisen!  

Come in, come in. Business is slow today so take any seat in the house. 

Reisen: Oh, uh... I'm just passing through.

Miyoi: [expression] sad 

Miyoi: Boo hoo.

And after you promised during last nights party... 

Reisen: Right, uh I don't really remember. What's your name? 

Miyoi: [expression] shock

Miyoi: Whaaaaa-? 

Don't tell me you forgot the <b>Poster Girl of Geidontei?</b> 

Miyoi: [expression] happy  

It's me! <b>Miyoi Okunoda. </b>

Reisen: Ohhh, its coming back to me now! You brought that really good sake and stewed vegtables.

Miyoi: Yeah! 

Miyoi: [expression] normal 

Anyways, it's good to see a familiar face.  

Everyone looks so different today.

Is it some sort of holiday? 

Reisen: Wait, you can see whats going on? 

Miyoi: Well, I can tell there's some sort of incident.

After all none of the regulars have come around today, and I couldn't find the owner anywhere. 

Reisen: It's strange that you weren't affected. 

Miyoi: Maybe the instigators just forgot about me.

[expression] heh

Wouldn't be the first time heh heh.... 

[expression] sad   

... 

[expression] shock

A-anyways.

[expression] happy 

To make up for forgetting your promise you better come by later ok! 

And bring any friends you meet too! 

Reisen: Sure thing.

[expression] annoy 

**What a hardworking girl...

[expression] ugh 

**I hope master treats me to good meal after this is all done!
