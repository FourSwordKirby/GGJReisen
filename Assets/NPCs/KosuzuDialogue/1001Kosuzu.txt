Reisen: Why did you want that scroll from earlier so much?
Kosuzu: Oh, are you curious?
IÅfm able to read it, you know? Pretty cool isnÅft it?
Ah, but even though I can read it, it doesnÅft really make any sense.
It seems to be a schematic for some kind of device.
Something aboutÅc <b>reduced dimensionality</b> storage?
By lowering the ÅgcomplexityÅh of an object, the device is able to fit more objects inside than normal.
It comes with a reversal process called Ågfeature reconstructionÅh that can <b>rebuild objects back into their original form</b>.
What does that mean? I have no ideaÅc
IÅfve never seen this language in books from the Outside World. 
This must be some kind of invention made in Gensokyo, right?
Reisen: **This is for the Dimensionality Reducer outside!
