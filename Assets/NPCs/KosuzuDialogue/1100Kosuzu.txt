Kosuzu: Whoa! What’s going on!? Everything’s blocky and gray! 

Was I one of those blocky things too!? 

Reisen: Yes, I cured you with one of my elixirs. 

Kosuzu: Wow, jee thanks! Nice bunny ear head band. It’s very cute! 

Reisen: Huh? O-oh. Yeah. (I can’t tell her these are real…) 

Kosuzu: Wow this is so bizarre. Is this caused by youkai? 

Hey you! You should get back home and stay safe. 

It’s time for me to shine. I’ll figure out a way to solve this myself! 

Reisen: (Huh? Did I make a mistake giving her the elixir?)
