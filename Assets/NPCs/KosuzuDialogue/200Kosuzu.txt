Bell: Welcome to the book shop! We have a wide assortment of books! 

Huh? You can’t tell the difference between the books? That’s weird. 

Look, this is a book about stuff. And this one is about different stuff! 

Reisen: (They look like the same gray cubes to me…) 

Reisen: (It seems like I wasn’t able to restore her full individuality.) 

 

 

Fourth Interaction 

Reisen: Why did you want that scroll from earlier so much? 

Kosuzu: Oh, are you curious? 

I’m able to read it, you know? Pretty cool isn’t it? 

Ah, but even though I can read it, it doesn’t really make any sense. 

It seems to be a schematic for some kind of device. 

Something about… reduced dimensionality travel? 

By lowering the “complexity” of an object, it can be “transmitted” at much higher speeds. 

This device has some kind of reversal process called “feature reconstruction” to rebuild “high dimensionality matter.” 

What does that mean? I have no idea… 

I don’t think this is from the Outside World. So, this must be some kind of magic, right? 

Reisen: (This is for the Dimensionality Reducer outside!) 

(+1 Information about the Dimensionality Reducer)
