Blockway Pixies is a pixelated version of the previous font release, Blockway.

How to use the font:
It's simple! You can overlap both solid(capitals) and hollow(lowercase) letterforms for a full color experience.

Diffeneces:
In the previous font, the letterforms are actually proportional.
In the bitmap version, this is now a monospaced font.

Legends:
Capitals = Solid
Small letters = Hollow
# = Plain hollow
®(alt+0174) = Plain solid

Please enjoy this font.

Kids do their best now and are preparing. Please watch warmly until it is ready.
